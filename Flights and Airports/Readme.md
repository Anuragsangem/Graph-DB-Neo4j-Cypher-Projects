### Flight Data Analysis in Neo4j
#### Introduction: 
This project demonstrates how to import flight data from a CSV file into Neo4j using Cypher queries. The data includes information about flights, airports, and connections between them.


#### Instructions :
1. Load CSV and Create Nodes/ConstraintsCreate nodes for airports and flights and set constraints on unique properties.
2. Import Nodes and relationships import nodes for flights and airports and create relationships between them.
3. Query Flights CountRetrieve the total number of flights in the database.
4. Check SchemaDisplay the database schema for visualization.
5. Profiling QueryProfile a query to find flights between specific airports on a given date.
6. Add New RelationshipAdd a new relationship between airports based on flight data.
7. Count ConnectionsCount the total connections between airports.
8. Find Flights Between AirportsSearch for flights between specified airports on a given date.

#### Conclusion
This README provides an overview of how to import flight data into Neo4j and perform basic queries for analysis.
